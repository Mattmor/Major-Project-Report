%The abstract is an overview of the work you have done. Highlight the purpose of the work and the key outcomes of the work.

A van is used to transport Aberystwyth University's large robots to and
from test sites. These robots usually have to be manually driven into
and out of the van for transportation. The Robot driving itself into a van
project is an application that can be used to automate and streamline the
process of setting up large robots for field trials by loading and unloading
robots into and out of the transport van.

This project uses a forward facing LIDAR to guide the robot into and out
of the van. This LIDAR senses a specific succession of patterns when
driving into or out of the van and these patterns are used to control the
robot to drive the correct path into and out of the van, given a roughly similar starting position.
